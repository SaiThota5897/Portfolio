About This Page
This webpage serves as an interactive professional portfolio and resume, developed using the Streamlit framework. It dynamically retrieves and parses data from GitHub repositories to present an up-to-date overview of professional credentials and projects. The design emphasizes clarity, usability, and maintainability. The source code for this webpage is available and can be shared upon request. The development involves the following technologies with their approximate contributions:
Python and Streamlit (80%) — core application logic and user interface
Requests and REST APIs (10%) — data acquisition from external sources such as GitHub
HTML and CSS (10%) — styling and layout customization
